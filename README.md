# Notes

Exercising my knowledge in data structures and algorithms

# Algorithms

Algorithm - A set of instructions to describe the exact result

# Data Structures

- Data is information that is stored or processed by a computer
- Data Structures are containers, allowing to combine several pieces of into a single structure
  - Data structures help connect and group data
  - Data structures give us organization, storage, and access

### Data Type

- Data Type - An attribute of data that describes the values it can have and how the data can be used
- Different numerical data types have different precision, meaning the difference is the range of numerical values the data type can store
  - Ex. Difference between short, int, and long are just the precision
    - In Java:
      - Short - Range of -32,768 to 32,767 - 16 bits
      - Int - Range of ~-2 billion to ~2 billion - 32 bits
      - Long - Range of -(2^63) to 2^63 - 64 bits
- Primitive types have fixed sizes of bits

### Size of Data Structure
Size of data structure depends on
- Allocated space for structure
- Number of pieces of data
- Size of each data piece
